<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A major overhaul for Amigos was overdue. Their board had  set out to increase trips and volunteers considerably over the next few years. The web site would play a big part in the strategy to meet their goals. We had our work cut out for us.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> A fresh perspective gave us the opportunity to shape the site for several types of visitors: volunteers, staff, alumni and supporters. A sense of connection to young people and the communities we take them is the over arching message. The site gives new volunteers and their parents all they need to jump in. The project staff needs organization and resources. The alumni have a place to write their stories, share their pictures and continue to stay involved. Supporters need the big picture and that is what they will get. The site is available in both Spanish and English with Portuguese planned for the future.</p>
