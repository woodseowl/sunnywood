<h1>Our Idea</h1>

<p class="big">We choose to build creatively, constructively, and with purpose for  our clients, ourselves, and our community. This fundamental philosophy  is born from a <a href="/sense_of_place" title="A Sense of Place">sense of place</a> that permeates our approach not just to business, but life entirely.</p>

<p>We have passions for art, engineering, and sustainability (among  others). This leads us to work particularly within the world of  renewable energy and green building, but generally with companies that  express environmental responsiveness or enliven our local community of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca,_New_York" title="Ithaca, New York [Wikipedia]" target="_blank">Ithaca, New York</a>. It also makes us maddeningly attentive to detail and  sincerely interested in the success of our clients.</p>

<p>Sunnywood Design is the aegis under which we ply our trades.</p>

    <h2>The Evolution</h2>

<p>Sunnywood officially formed in July 2000 as a continuation of  work started at the <a href="http://www.crest.org" title="CREST" target="_blank">Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technology</a>. Sunnywood began as a sole proprietorship for Liz and Eric Woods. By 2005 we chose to expand our business, having successfully merged with one of our collaborators, Deviron. In considering how to manage growth, we pursued the idea of becoming <a href="collective.php">worker cooperative</a>. But outside forces  led us back to our roots and in 2008 we were presented with an unexpected opportunity to join a long-time client, <a href="http://www.psdconsulting.com" target="_blank">Performance Systems Devleopment</a>. Since that time we have led design and software development at PSD and maintained Sunnywood as a specialty shop for client web development.</p>
