<p>Our intent is to work creatively and cooperatively designing communication tools essential to any company, but particularly for those furthering the common good through environmental sustainability or local community.</p>

<h2>Develop</h2>
<p>We build tools for communication: web sites, visual identities, print design, interactive media, and other work, developed with a focus on <a href="services" title="Services: Design">comprehensive design</a>. We apply the same devotion to our craft whether it is basic graphic design  or complex database-driven web applications.</p>

<p>We come to this work not as designers, programmers, and production specialists, but as <a href="idea" title="Our Idea">people, passionate about community and environment</a>. We trust that as this work sustains us and our families it extends further to a more sustainable future for all.</p>
