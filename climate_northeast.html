<p><img src="/images/cne_homepage.jpg" width="287" height="291" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 6px 12px 6px -4px;" alt="Climate Northeast" /><strong>Challenge:</strong> World Resources Institute, or WRI, came to us to help move the Climate Northeast project up the priority list. It was time to create its own identity and establish a beautiful platform to build on.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> We went to work at the ground level creating a multitude of draft designs for the logotype. After many rounds of back and forth we arrived at a simple and attractive solution that carries symbolism and meaning to some of the Northeast's largest corporations. Easy access to the project's publications provide the public with high-level materials to plan ways to reduce pollution and maximize sustainability. Case studies also track the projects successes and benefits. A private side that grants secure access to corporate partners and serves as a clearing house for special resources for these parties.</p>
