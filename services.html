<h1>Sunnywood Services</h1>

<p>All of us at Sunnywood have diverse skills, background, and interests. We are generalists by nature, giving a well-rounded, well-educated perspective to the projects we take on. But working together we are able to sharpen our skills as specialists, each taking on our best parts of a project. Thus we are able to offer a broad range of services. When applied to a project, it is not a menu of options to choose from, it is a toolbox we dig into to best fit the job.</p>

<p class="big">We are no longer taking new work. We recommend <a href="https://awpny.com" target="_blank">Ancient Wisdom Productions</a> or <a href="https://singlebrook.com" target="_blank">Singlebrook Technologies</a> for high quality web development services.</p>

<!--	<p class="big">If you are interested in having us look at a project for you, we'd love to talk. All work is quoted on a custom basis and we can accommodate most any project need.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>Design is integral to everything we do.</p>

    <p>We are a communication company and it is essential that design be well-considered. We learn everything we can about a client and work collaboratively in a process of discovery, refinement, testing, and review.</p>

    <p>Our design work takes on many forms. At the most obvious it is visual design. Interface, information, and functional design are equally considered in web design and interactive media projects. For dynamic web sites or more complex web applications, we also consider the architectural design of the code. Regardless of the design, we work collaboratively here, building on each other's ideas internally and with the regular participation of our clients.</p>

    <h2>Web Site Production &amp; Programming</h2>

    <p>We apply the highest craftsmanship of our trade to every web site we produce. We have been designing, developing, and hosting web sites since 1994. We can build complex web applications and basic brochure sites, approaching each project uniquely, but with the efficiency of years of experience.</p>
