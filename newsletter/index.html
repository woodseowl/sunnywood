		<h1>Sunnywood Design Who?</h1>
		
		<p>We've been cooking up a lot of changes here at Sunnywood over the past year, and we'd like to share our enthusiasm with you!  Much has changed, but our dedication to our clients and the mission they serve remains. Our new staff has brought more depth to Sunnywood, both in experience and in passion for things that matter.  We invite you to read more about our idea and updated services at the new Sunnywood web site (<a href="http://www.sunnywooddesign.com">www.sunnywooddesign.com</a>).</p>
		
		<h2>People Power</h2>
		
		<p>The Sunnywood crew has expanded.  There are now four of us in the office most days, some days five. Together we directly support 17 people, including three at-home mothers and nine children. Here's how it happened, in order: </p>
		
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="http://www.sunnywooddesign.com/people.php#paul">Paul Adkins</a> joined our team last August as a graphic designer. He came to Ithaca with his family after a five year ride with Adventure Cycling in Missoula, Montana. As an avid cyclist he has expanded our emphasis on sustainability to include bicycles. But it was when he saw our disc golf target that we all knew it had to be. </li>
		  <li>Baby boom!  In September the Adkins family welcomed Dare September and Sanguine Sky into the world, and in October the Woods family was joined by Clara Lucille. They help us keep things in perspective. </li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.sunnywooddesign.com/people.php#bob">Bob Rossi</a>  had been working for us on an as-needed basis since we merged with Deviron in January 2005. We were able to bring him on as a staff member in January 2006, specializing in communications, web production, and project management. His keen interest in local small business has been helping us stay connected to our community.</li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.sunnywooddesign.com/people.php#ericb">Eric Banford</a> was hired as our second staff programmer in February. After a five year tenure at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology he was ready to dive into the world of small business with us. His interests in birding and green building give us plenty to talk about. </li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.sunnywooddesign.com/people.php#katy">Katy Nicholson</a> has become an indispensable core contractor for us, working on projects since last fall. Family connections helped bring her to the area and we're hoping the Sunnywood connection helps keep her here. </li>
	    </ul>
		
		<h2>Power to the People</h2>
		
		<p>We are inspired by social good. We try to live by values that improve our world. One way were are taking action on that is to transform Sunnywood into a fully employee-owned cooperative. You may have noticed our name change. It is but one step in restructuring our company to reflect the value of community.  As a worker cooperative, Sunnywood will offer employees the opportunity to become owners with an equal share in decision-making and profit-sharing. We're really excited about this new direction and would be happy to discuss details. </p>
		<h2>Recent Projects</h2>
		
		<p>Amidst all of this new activity, we've had plenty of projects afoot. Here are a few of note: </p>
		<ul>
		  <li><a href="http://www.rockinghorsecafe.com/">Rocking Horse Cafe</a>: A much-celebrated Mexican restaurant in New York City, Rocking Horse got a fresh look and a snazzy web-enabled takeout menu. We'll be rolling out calendar and newsletter features for them, too. But what we can't wait for is when their delivery area extends to Ithaca. </li>
		  <li><em><a href="http://www.sunnywooddesign.com/climatecrisis.php" title="Case Study: An Inconvenient Truth">An Inconvenient Truth</a></em>: Thanks to work we'd done on the carbon footprint calculator for <abbr title="World Resources Institute">WRI</abbr>, Sunnywood was called in as the technical advisor for Participant Productions' carbon calculator on climatecrisis.net.  Eric W. was privileged to work directly with Al Gore on this site that supports the new documentary <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>.</li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.sunnywooddesign.com/bikeleague.php" title="Case Study: League of American Bicyclists">League of American Bicyclists</a>: Paul turned us on to the great work that the League does helping promote two-wheeled transportation, then he helped turn their web site into a great tool for promoting the League. This site got a complete rework, from graphics and navigation to online member tools and a new  store. </li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.sustainabletompkins.org">Sustainable Tompkins</a>: Eric W. and Noah volunteered time to design the site and and develop a content management system for this great local organization.  Katy, an active ST participant, now assists with site maintenance.</li>
		  <li>Lehman Alternative Community School: Sunnywood helped LACS's work-intensive, paper-only evaluations system go digital.  This set of student and teacher evaluations is used for all students in lieu of letter grades and is a critical part of the school's student assessments.</li>
	    </ul>
		  
		<p>If you'd like to see some other projects, look at our new <a href="http://www.sunnywooddesign.com/portfolio.php" title="Sunnywood Portfolio">portfolio</a>. </p>
		<h2>Outside the Office </h2>
		  
		<p>On a personal note... </p>
		  
		<ul>
          <li>As in years past, Sunnywood is sponsoring a team in the <a href="http://www.iaua.com/">Ithaca Area Ultimate Alliance</a> summer league, and Paul, Eric W., and Bob are all playing in the league (on separate teams). So far it's Paul 1, Eric 0 and we'll see if anyone meets in the playoffs. </li>
		  <li>Eric B. might have made it out to the Ultimate fields with us, but he and his family are busy building a house just a few miles down the road. The whole office gets the daily play-by-play and we're happy he's been able to make this green building dream come true. </li>
		</ul>
		  
		<h2>Give Us a Call! </h2>
		  
		<p>With all this new talent and expanded capabilities, it's a great time to get in touch with us about a project. We'd love to show you some of the other work we've been up to or give you a chance to meet the new folks.  </p>
