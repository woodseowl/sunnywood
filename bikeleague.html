<h2>League of American Bicyclists</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.bikeleague.org" target="_blank"><img src="/images/league_homepage.jpg" width="287" height="274" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 6px 12px 6px -4px;" alt="League of American Bicyclists" /></a><strong>Challenge:</strong> The League, America's oldest membership cycling organization, came to us to help them redesign their site. Three primary issues were evident: the site had become unorganized and not easy to find things, it was outdated visually, and there was opportunity to integrate outside processes and systems to increase productivity and member services.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> With a keen eye for branding we took the best of there new identity pieces, namely the <em>American Bicyclist</em> magazine, and styled a consistent feel to bolster the strength of the organization. Using web standards (XHTML and CSS) and PHP we established a beautiful home page and template for subsequent pages that clearly defined the sites departments and their contents. We upgraded the calendar, store and the sign-up process. We integrated the powerful "Find It" feature that allows the viewer to find shops, clubs, instructors, courses, events, rides and seminars based on city, state or zip limiting it to a specified radius of your location.</p>
