  <p>This document lists guidelines on submitting content to us in a format that allows us to build your website quickly, efficiently, and thoroughly. While every project varies, delivering the content provided in the format highlighted below significantly streamlines the process of content publishing. If you feel the approach below will not work for you, please inform us before the project begins so that we can adjust our own process and estimates for time needed accordingly.</p>
  
	<h2>Schedule</h2>

	<ul><li>Please compile all the content for the site at one time and deliver it before the start of the production phase of the project</li></ul>
	
	<h2>Text Format</h2>

	<ul>
	<li>Text content can be delivered in plain text in Word, OpenOffice, Notepad, Simpletext, or any other editable document type agreed upon</li>
	<li>Headings, subheadings, and other site-specific styles can be stylized, but all other text should have no style. Text need not include layout elements such as specific margins or line spacing as these will not carry over to the website.</li>
	<li>Formats such as PDFs, hard copy, faxes, etc. will incur an additional hourly charge outside of the design quote or contract to convert them to a web-ready format </li>
	</ul>



<h2>Text Organization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The text for the whole site should be delivered as one document with web page titles heading the content intended for each web page    </li>
  <li>If there are multiple columns of content specific to a page, title them accordingly (e.g., Left Column Content, Right Column Content).    </li>
  <li>Content that is repeated across multiple pages does not need to be duplicated, but can be referred to    </li>
  <li>Images embedded in text can be referenced using the following convention:  [file name in brackets, caption text]    </li>
  <li>Links can be delivered formatted as links in the content document (e.g., links in Word) or as _underlined_text_ [<a href="#">http://and-corresponding-URL.html</a>]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Images</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Images can be delivered by email, on CD, on DVD, posted via FTP, or by any other agreed upon method.    </li>
  <li>Images must be delivered digitally    </li>
  <li>Photos should be jpeg format unless otherwise agreed upon.    </li>
  <li>Photos should be delivered in the highest resolution. Sunnywood will compress the images for optimal use on the site.    </li>
  <li>Images that are not photos should be described ahead of time so that the appropriate filetype and delivery method can be chosen. </li>
</ul>
