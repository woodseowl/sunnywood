<h1>Design Portfolio</h1>

<p>At Sunnywood, design is the art of listening, learning, creating and giving purposeful structure to ideas that drive compelling and useful communication. These projects and their case studies offer insight into our design methods by showing the results of our work.</p>

<h2>Cornell Plantations</h2>
<p><a href="/plantations"><img src="/images/plantations.jpg" width="72" height="74" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 4px 7px 6px -4px;" alt="Cornell Plantations" /></a>Cornell University has a botanical garden and an arboretum right in the heart of the campus and supports numerous local natural areas for preserveration of biodiversity and as a natural classroom. Sunnywood put the visual beauty of the Plantations out front and let the navigation of this deep site stand in support. All of it administered by a sophisticated content managment system so that Plantations staff can keep it fresh. <a href="/plantations">See the case study</a>.</p>

<h2>League of American Bicyclists</h2>
<p><a href="/bikeleague"><img src="/images/league_homepage.jpg" width="72" height="82" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 4px 7px 6px -4px;" alt="Bike League" /></a>The League, America's oldest bicycling advocacy organization&mdash;established in 1880&mdash;asked us to cast off everything but their logo and start fresh in a redesign of their large, out-dated site. A few significant brand elements had recently undergone updating and we advised the group to fashion a consistent character by drawing on visual cues from the redesign of the <em>American Bicyclist</em>, their membership magazine. <a href="/bikeleague">See the case study</a>.</p>


<h2>Climate Northeast</h2>
<p><a href="/climate_northeast"><img src="/images/cne_homepage.jpg" width="72" height="73" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 4px 7px 0px -4px;" alt="www.climatenortheast.org" /></a>As a project of the World Resources Institute, Climate Northeast was ready for a major overhaul. The project had grown nicely without any visual identity and at this point the leaders felt it was time for a logo as well. So we started from the very foundation, presenting many iterations of marks and concepts for the logo and logotype. <a href="/climate_northeast">See the case study</a>.</p>

<h2>Amigos de las Am&#233;ricas</h2>
<p><a href="/amigos"><img src="/images/amigos_homepage.jpg" width="72" height="73" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 4px 7px 0px -4px;" alt="www.amigoslink.org" /></a>Looking for vast improvement and hopes of solving some of the inherent issues with the old site Amigos came to us for a ground up redesign. We quickly headed off to Houston, Texas, the international headquarters, for the critical discovery phase. With the varied constituents we needed to solicit new volunteers, attract and educate program staff, create a virtual community for alumni and finally petition and recognize major supporters. We had our work cut out for us. <a href="/amigos">See the case study</a>.</p>

<h2>Solar Nation</h2>
<p><a href="/solarnation"><img src="/images/solarnation_homepage.jpg" width="72" height="82" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 4px 7px 6px -4px;" alt="www.solar-nation.org" /></a>A new coalition of partners from many renewable energy sectors came to us to build the site for Solar Nation. They told us they wanted to be the political action home for solar power. The site necessitated effortless management to add, edit and archive the articles that link to an integrated outside advocacy service. The site builds a database of contacts and facilitate solar news distribution with the sole purpose of activating people across our nation, asking everyone to wave the solar flag. <a href="/solarnation">See the case study</a>.</p>
