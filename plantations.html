<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> The content-rich Cornell Plantations site was a patchwork of features and maintenance systems. This beautiful location needed a beautiful site to match and a content management system to support several departments.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> With material as rich as the wildflower gardens and thousands of professional photographs to work with, it was not hard to see a site filled with imagery. However, the site needed to not overwhelm the visitor while still presenting a considerable depth of features and information. It also had to preserve both the Plantations look and feel and Cornell University branding. These pieces came together in a design that puts the visuals front and center and lets the content and navigation serve in a supporting role. While you enjoythis online visit to the Plantations, be sure to check out the Find a Plant &quot;mashup&quot; that uses a wonderful watercolor map of the plantations server through the Google Maps engine. The site uses the Drupal CMS with many advanced features and custom modules.</p>
