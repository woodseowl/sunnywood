<h2>Solar Nation</h2>

<p><img src="/images/solarnation_homepage.jpg" width="287" height="326" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 6px 12px 0px -4px;" alt="Solar Nation" /><strong>Challenge:</strong> A coalition of interests came to Sunnywood wanting a site designed, logo designed and functionality that would provide the tools of a political action group. The mission is simple, to help change state and federal policy to make solar power a significant part of America's energy future.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> Creating a strong identity that brings people together and helps individual citizens raise their solar flag was challenging with such diverse interests. The site seamlessly integrates with Capital Advantage providing all the features and functionality that the best political action groups need. The administrators can easily log in to a simple interface and add the new updates with images and the public side displays and archives them effortlessly. The timeline on this project was just three weeks.</p>
